The purpose of this project is to design, develop and release a Blues
guitar-oriented multi-effects unit. It will draw heavily upon the legacy of
excellent guitar effects circuits that have been developed over the past seven
(or so) decades. The Blues Box will identify a set of high-quality effects
circuits for inclusion
